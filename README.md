# Octus Aadhaar Offline SDK - iOS
![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v1.3.3-blue)

Aadhaar Paperless Offline eKYC is a secure and shareable document which can be used by any Aadhaar holder for offline verification of identification. The Aadhaar Offline document can be obtained from the UIDAI website. This SDK provides a simple plugin to your mobile App which allows the user to seamlessly share their offline Aadhaar file with the service provider. 


There are two ways the SDK can be configured within your App. The first one is an in-app experience whereby the pre-built screens will allow the Aadhaar holder to enter the Aadhaar Number or VID, Captcha, OTP and four digit share code all within your App without redirecting to the UIDAI website. The Aadhaar Offline file once downloaded will be parsed in-memory and displayed in the App (data shared with the App as JSON data). The experience is seamless with the in-app option.


The second option is to redirect the user to the UIDIAI website and allow the user to follow the instructions provided by the website. The user can enter the Aadhaar Number or VID, captcha, OTP and four digit share code in the website. Once the data is validated by UIDAI, a ZIP file (password protected using the share code) will be downloaded into the residentâ€™s device. The user will now have to switch back to your App and select the file from the devices download folders which will parse the data and display them in the App (data shared with the App as JSON data). 


In both cases, the Aadhaar Offline file will be validated for its digital signature and the KYC data of The Aadhaar holder will be passed to the integrating App as JSON data.

## Prerequisite


You will need a valid license to use the Octus Aadhaar Offline SDK, which can be obtained by contacting `support@frslabs.com` 

Depending on the license - offline or online - you have opted for, the ping functionality to billing servers will be disabled or enabled. For instance, if you have opted for the offline SDK model, then there will be no server ping needed to our billing server to bill you. However, if you have chosen a transaction based pricing, then after each transaction, a ping request will be made to our billing server. This cannot be overrided by the App. A point to note is that if the ping transaction fails for any reason, the whole transaction will be void without any results from the SDK.

## Minimum Requirements

- Xcode 12.5
- iOS 12.0+
- Swift 5.0

## Installation

#### CocoaPods
You can use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) to install `aadhaarOffline` by adding it to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
source 'https://gitlab.com/frslabs-public/ios/aadhaaroffline.git'
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
use_frameworks!
pod 'aadhaarOffline','1.3.3'
```

To get the full benefits import `aadhaarOffline` wherever you import UIKit

``` swift
import UIKit
import aadhaarOffline
```


## Usage example

### Swift

1. Initialize the input parameters and import delegate AadhaarResultDelegate
```swift

import UIKit
import aadhaarOffline

class ViewController: UIViewController,AadhaarResultDelegate{
    func didReceiveAadhaarResult(_ data: AadhaarResults) {
  
    let referenceId = data.aadhaarData?.aadhaar_reference_id
    let timeStamp   = data.aadhaarData?.aadhaar_time_stamp
    let name        = data.aadhaarData?.aadhaar_name
    let careOf.     = data.aadhaarData?.aadhaar_care_of
    let dob         = data.aadhaarData?.aadhaar_dob
    let gender      = data.aadhaarData?.aadhaar_gender
    let house       = data.aadhaarData?.aadhaar_house
    let street      = data.aadhaarData?.aadhaar_street
    let lm          = data.aadhaarData?.aadhaar_landmark
    let loc.        = data.aadhaarData?.aadhaar_location
    let dist        = data.aadhaarData?.aadhaar_district
    let state.      = data.aadhaarData?.aadhaar_state
    let country     = data.aadhaarData?.aadhaar_country
    let pc.         = data.aadhaarData?.aadhaar_postCode
    let facePhoto.  = data.aadhaarData?.aadhaar_photo
     
    }
    
    func didFailedAadhaarResult(_ error: String) {
     print(error)
    }
    
    2. Invoke Aadhaar offline SDK
   
    override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool){
    
     Aadhaar.performSegueToFrameworkVC(caller: self, licenceKey: "LICENCE_KEY_OCTUS_AADHAR_OFFLINE_SDK", buttonColourCode: "ENTER HEX BUTTON COLOUR CODE" ?? "" ,                                       buttonTextColourCode: "ENTER HEX TEXT COLOUR CODE" ?? "")
        Aadhaar.aadhaarDelegate = self  
    }
   
```

## Octus Error Codes

Error codes and their meaning are tabulated below

| Code          | Message              |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| 1101  |  Licence Expired          |
| 1102  |  Licence Invalid            |
| 1103  | Invalid File URL            |
| 1104  | Incorrect Zip  File Password    |
| 1105  | Transaction Fail         |
| 1106  | Internet Connection        |
| 1107  | SDK Interupt        |
| 1108  | UIDAI server is down        |
| 1109  | AAdhaar validation failed        |
| 1110  | Session expired       |


#### SDK configuration. 

This part of the integration allows you to integrate the drop-in screens for the in-app experience whereby the Aadhaar holder will enter the Aadhaar Number, Captcha, OTP and four digit share code all within your App without redirecting to the UIDAI website. The Aadhaar Offline file once downloaded will be parsed in-memory and displayed in the App (data shared with the App as JSON data). The experience is seamless with the in-app option. However, one of the caveats to this configuration is that any change to the UIDIA website will need to be updated and is a reactive release and there is a risk of your App not working until the changes reflect in the SDK.
